Title: SEO-Marketing-Brochure-Refactor

Introduction: The goal of this refactor is to make the code more readable while ensuring site functionality, user appeal, and ease of use. Items were changed to the index.html and .css files to achineve this goal (changes listed below).

Technologies: No external technologies were used for this program.

Launch: No data is required to launch this code. Site will function without access to pictures.

Scope of Functionalities: This is a simple brochure with active anchor links at the top. Their purpose is to rediret you to your click of interest. Alt tags have been added as part of the refactor, allowing screen-readers to function if images cannot load.

Problems Faced: Some of the items in the .css file were very similar, but identified unique parameters within classes. These similar items were grouped together when oragnizing the .css.

Potential Future Plans: More links and functionality to the brochure. Hyperlinks added to Horiseon website. Hover properties for semantic sections to show more information or prompt "click for more information". Add contact information. Possibly curtail
the brochure to be more customer-focused, based on who that may be.

Table of Contents: The code follows this structure:
Head
Body
Main
Aside
Footer
The style.css follows this structure:
Reset
Global Parameters
Header
Semantic Elements
Float Properties
BENEFIT-LEAD PROPERTIES
BENEFIT-BRAND PROPERTIES
BENEFIT-COST PROPERTIES
SEARCH-ENGINGE-OPTIMIZATION PROPERTIES
